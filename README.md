## Helios Userinterface Study

This project is a collection of three different user-interfaces for the remote electronic voting protocol Helios.<br />
As this solely is the user-interface a component for tallying and administering elections is not included. <br />
Furthermore encryption is only simulated and thus we do not recomment to use this interface for serious elections as secrecy can be broken easily.
